## Our Start Up Story 

Although they had different backgrounds and career pursuits over the years the idea of building a cafe together grew stronger. Finally 2022, they decided to take the plunge and start the business. 
At the begining there were some issues but nothing that they could not figure out and fix together. There were some delays in in permits and there were doubts from those around them whether the busineess would succeed. Nevertheless, they perseveered and put the cafe together. 
Opening day was both exciting and nervewracking and they soon realized what they would have to work on to make the business successful. 
As the weeks passed, they started to build a loyal community and subsequentially became successful. Not only for their coffee, but because the cafe has a become a place where persons come for inspiration, connection and ofcourse, a cup of coffee. 

As the business continued to grow we knew we needed to form a group of skilled individuals to provide clients with the best expierience possible that is how we contracted, the barista and , the events manager.
