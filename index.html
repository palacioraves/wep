       <h1>About Us</h1>
           <p>This cafe started with a simple dream: to bring exceptional coffe and comunity together.   
            Our founders, two lifelong friends with a passion for coffee, embarked on a journey to create a space where people could escape, connect and indulge in quality coffee. 
            
            We partner with farmers who enforce eco-friendly practices to grow and harvest our beans.
            We pride ourselves in being a part of the local scene and support neighborhood events, artisans and creatives. 
            From the beans to the brew, every cup is crafted with care, serve fresh, and designed to bring joy and comfort.
            We are also very selective on our employees, ensuring they have the skills and qualities to provide the best experience possible.</p>
